# Network Speed Tracker
This project will monitor home network speed over an extended period of time using a raspberry pi 4 model b.

# Goal
The goal of the project is to gain more insight into how our home network performes over an extended period by running speedtests at a pre-determined intervals. This plotted in a graph will then hopefully allow us to detect a longer running problem with our network as it has seen some degredation over the last couple of weeks.
<br/> <br/>
Another goal is also to get more familiar with the raspberry pi 4 model b, and how it can be used to set up automation tasks
