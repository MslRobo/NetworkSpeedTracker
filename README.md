# Network Speed Tracker
This project will monitor home network speed over an extended period of time using a raspberry pi 4 model b.
The goal of the project is to gain more insight into how our home network performes over an extended period by running speedtests at a pre-determined intervals. This plotted in a graph will then hopefully allow us to detect a longer running problem with our network as it has seen some degredation over the last couple of weeks.

# Tools
This project will utilize a raspberry pi 4 model b and the speedtesting standard from Ookla at <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest.net</a>
